## Code Quality & Validation
- Input validation is implemented for all forms
- Empty input fields are restricted
- Duplicate events are prevented
- Error messages are shown using dialog boxes
- Confirmation dialogs are used before delete actions

---

## Testing
- Application was tested with empty inputs
- Duplicate event entries were tested
- Delete actions were tested with and without selection
- Application handles invalid operations without crashing

---

## Innovation / Extra Effort
- Improved user interaction using dialog-based feedback
- Added confirmation dialogs for safe deletion
- Prevented duplicate event entries
- Enhanced UI readability and usability

---

## Teamwork & Collaboration
This project was developed as a team effort:

- **Shubh Vishnoi (Team Leader):** Core logic, GUI design, integration, validation
- **Sudhanshu Raj:** UI styling and layout support
- **Prakash Kumar:** Testing, documentation, and validation support

---

## How to Run
1. Open the project in any Java-supported IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse / NetBeans)
2. Compile and run `CollegeFestApp.java`
3. The application will open as a desktop window

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the practical use of Java Swing, event handling,
validation techniques, and clean coding practices. It fulfills all the
requirements specified for Review 2.
