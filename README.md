# College-Fest-Management-System

Streamlined platform for organizing fests

This project is a desktop application built using Java Swing to help manage the different activities of a college fest.  
We wanted to create something simple, clean, and easy to use so that anyone in the cultural or technical team can operate it without confusion.

## 🎯 Project Overview

College fests involve a lot of work happening at the same time—event creation, participant registration, managing volunteers, and more.  
To make this easier, we created a system that brings everything together in one interface.

### ✔ Event Management
Add events with their venue and date, view all events in a list, and delete any event when required.

### ✔ Participant Registration
Register students for specific events and store their year of study.  
All participants appear in a clean list so it's easy to manage.

### ✔ Volunteer Management
Add volunteers along with their department and manage the volunteer list with ease.

### ✔ User-Friendly Interface
The UI has a blue-white color theme, neat spacing, and tabs for quick navigation.  
The goal was to make it look modern without being complicated.
